 Android Debug Bridge (adb) is a versatile tool lets you manage the state of an
 emulator instance or Android-powered device. It is a client-server program
 that includes three components:

 A client, which runs on your development machine. You can invoke a client
 from a shell by issuing an adb command. Other Android tools such as the ADT
 plugin and DDMS also create adb clients.  
 .
 A server, which runs as a background process on your development machine.
 The server manages communication between the client and the adb daemon
 running on an emulator or device.

 A daemon, which runs as a background process on each emulator or device
 instance.
