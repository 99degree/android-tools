android-tools for Debian
------------------------

The upstream tarball is based of these upstream Android git repos:
    git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core
    git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/extras

with unneeded files removed.

The debian/create-snapshot script may be used to generate an
android-tools.tar.xz from the latest upstream; see this script for a list of
files to copy from upstream into the tarball.
